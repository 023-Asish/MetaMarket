**Problem Statement**

**Limited Access to Services**

Not everyone knows the wide range of

professional service persons from different

domains

**Limitation of E-commerce**

If a person purchases any product like a TV or

AC from an online marketplace, the

installation will require some workers.

**Limitation of Service providing app**

Service-providing applications typically do not

offer products; however, our application

distinguishes itself by providing both services

and products to enhance the overall

experience for customers and workers
